# Tetris
### Description
-----
Welcome to Swiftris (Tetris written in Swift)! This game has many familiar features such as :

* 20x10 Tetris board and 7 differently colored Tetrominos

* Line is cleared from the board once an entire row is filled 

* Yes, there are wall kicks!

* Additional features such as scores, levels, floor kicks, T-spins, and most importantly, music may be implemented in the future 

I referenced additional details such as Tetromino names, shadow colors, or wall kicks using https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetris_Wiki. If you are not familiar with Tetris, feel free to read up the instructions from this page. 

I would also like to add that I have referenced https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsgr7nAvsNLvUybqIJp3ySA to learn more about building Swiftris. I definitely recommend the channel for programmers who are new to Swift.

### Compile / Run
-----
The simplest way to run Swift programs on MacOS is to download XCode. Make sure your OS is up to date before downloading the program.


### Files
